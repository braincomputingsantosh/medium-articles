# Medium Article Code Repository

Welcome to my code repository! This repository contains all the code examples, scripts, and projects referenced in my Medium articles.

## 📚 About This Repository

This repository serves as a companion to my Medium articles, providing readers with:
- Complete, runnable code examples
- Supplementary materials and resources
- Extended implementations beyond what's shown in the articles
- Bug fixes and updates to published code

## 🗂️ Repository Structure

Each article's code is organized in its own directory, named with the publication date and article title for easy reference:

```
├── YYYY-MM-DD-article-title/
│   ├── README.md          # Article-specific documentation
│   ├── requirements.txt   # Dependencies (if applicable)
│   └── src/              # Source code files
```
